# Housemate Managing App

Our app will be used by the members of a 
house who wish to keep track of house
chores, information and needed items in one
centralized, organized app. This app will
allow for users to form a group representing
the house. 

### Why Create this App?
Our main thought process behind the
creation of this app is that every group
of housemates/roommates has some way of
tracking lists of chores/groceries, money,
and other items. Many people just use a
whiteboard and dry-erase marker or leaving
notes on a board. This app will allow for
users to do this using their phones.

We also know that often times, housemates
will routinely spend money on items and 
request others to split the cost. This cycle
will often repeat frequently and lead to 
the same small amount of money moving back
and forth between housemates. Our app
will allow for the amount owed from person
to person to be tracked and changed when 
one or the other spends money and requests
from another.

### Key Features:
- Create and edit Shopping Lists
- Create a chore lists
- System will automatically assign chores evenly
- Track Payments and who owes who money and 
how much money they owe
- When groceries are bought, it will tell users how 
much they owe as well as remove that item from the
shopping list
- Track inventory in the house

### Stakeholder Goals Summary:
- **Housemate:**  view and add to lists of needed 
items/groceries, or list of chores to be done and track
payments.
