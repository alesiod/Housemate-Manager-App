Requirements Documentation Update:

We underwent two substantial changes during this iteration, the first being removing the FeeTracker class and the Debt class. We moved the FeeTracker and Debt functionality to the House, Housemate, Inventory, and ReceiptItem classes, as we found FeeTracker and Debt redundant. The second change we had was creating the Main and Manager classes so that user input and receipt creation had their own dedicated classes.
