#To Do for Iteration 2:

1. Turn existing code into Android App
2. Implement chore list and debt function
3. Make up-to-date fully dressed use case for all use cases
4. Test report for both system test (app) and unit tests (test classes)
5. update needed documentation (iterations 3 plan, README.md, etc)
